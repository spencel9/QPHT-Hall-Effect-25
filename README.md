# QPHT-Hall-Effect-25

## Version 1.0

### Purpose:

The purpose of the code found in this GitHub repository is to measure the Quantum Hall Effect in different materials. At this point in time, we do not have a final completed program for the actual measuring of the Hall Effect in different materials, but we do have an interactive UI for measuring the resistance across a resistor using a 4-wire configuration.

### Installation Requirements:

- Python v3.8 or higher
- All required packages:
  - Numpy
  - PyMeasure
- The single Python file titled: "Keithley_2450_Sourcemeter_Interface_v1.0.py"


### Usage:

To run this program, simply execute the Python file (can be through an IDE or the terminal/command prompt.

This is a very interactive program, a list of some UI functionalities can be found below:

- Movable figure configurations when multiple figures are present (See comments in code or PyMeasure Documentation on ManagedDockWindows)
- Savable figure layout (Right-click any blue Dock banner to save your current configuration)
- Saving directory navigation
- UI file-naming
- Queueing of different experiments (aka changing the parameters)
- Progress bar and current status of an experiment
- Multiple experiments on the same plot (can turn on/off)
- Accurate x- and y-axis unit that change when you zoom in/out
- Experiment Log of functionality
- Saves experimental data to a csv


  Have fun and be safe!
